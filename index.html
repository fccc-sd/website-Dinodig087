 <!--The body contains a short brief explanation of my life and experiences -->
<body>
 <p>
Born and raised in northwest ohio and lived around Napoleon and mcclure for 
most of my life. Ive only been out of ohio just a hand full of times but last summer 
me and my dad when on a trip to florida. The only boring part of the trip was that we 
drove there we drove through Kentucky. through tennesee the mountins in Tennesee are so  
beautiful I see why my uncle loves Tennesee so much plus thats where he was born so I see why.
We also had to drive though Georgia there wasn't much to see in Georgia but the only thing that 
we did in Georgia was we when though Atlanta.

<h3>Family </h3>

<body>
    <p>     I don't have much family on my dads side because he came from 
        Alaska and not that many people of our family came with him to ohio. But I
         do have a large family on my moms side because she basically grew up in ohio 
         also my grandma has a house that they all like to linger around chilling. 
         Its a nice big house in the county so alot of people can be there at one time 
         but sometimes it feels like a ghost town when everyone is busy and no one is 
         there except my grandma and my mom and my step-dad from time to time. I mostly 
         like going out there because I don't really get to see my mom alot so it's always 
         nice to go out of the way to see her. Also it's just fun to hangout with everyone 
         that I used to hangout with when I was young it gives the feeling of that time stands
          still but in reality it doesn't.
