<h5> <p>  I don't have much hobbies I like to 
    play football from time to time I had 
    two friends that I played with 
    on a daily but I had to move. Also it 
    doen't help one time I was playing reciver 
    I got pinned and spraned my leg Good thing 
    that my friend's mom was a nurse so she came 
    out to check me out when it first happend 
    because I could barely even walk they had 
    to carry me to my house. I also like  to play 
    Baseball it's always been  close to my heart 
    because that was the only thing I would really
     play when I was young. My uncles would allways 
     try to take the lether off of the ball whenever 
     someone would pitch it to either one of them. 
     The reason why I got into baseball is that both 
     of my uncles played baseball growing up and they 
     just passed the passion for the game over.
